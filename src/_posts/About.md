I have worked in technology for over 20 years.  I worked at Microsoft
consulting enterprise customers with SharePoint and Office 365. My skills include
both IT Pro and Development.  I started out doing IT operations, but as more of my
customers moved to the cloud, my focus has been more on the Development side.

I am passionate about technology and I really enjoy digging in and learning new
technologies.
